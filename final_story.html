			<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
			<p>You’re lying if you say you’ve never let your curiosity get the better of you and ventured to Google or IMDb to research the actors in your favorite TV shows or movies. There’s an aspect of relatability that comes along with knowing the name behind the screen. </p> 

			<p> But how often are those actors wildly older than the characters they're portraying? </p> 

			<p> Amber Thomas is a data visualization journalist-engineer and current community lead for Data World who manually collected a <a href="https://data.world/amberthomas/age-of-characters-and-actors-in-teen-tv-shows" target="_blank"> dataset </a> to gain a better understanding of the age differences between teen characters in TV shows and the actors who portray them. </p>

			<p> Ben Platt’s feature as a high school student on The Politician initially sparked Thomas’ research on the dataset. Interestingly enough, as he got older, the characters Platt was portraying were adversely getting younger. </p>

			<p> In 2012 he played a college freshman in the movie Pitch Perfect, then in 2019 he played a high school senior in The Politician, and in 2021 he played a high school junior in the movie Dear Evan Hansen. </p>

			<p> Thomas wanted to see if other actors had similar résumés to Platt’s mentioned above, so her research and data collection commenced from there. </p>

			<h3>FIRST HAND EXPERIENCES</h3>

			<p>While she herself never played a character much outside of her age range, former child actress, Meg Crosbie, saw firsthand actors who did. </p>

			<p> “It’s very common for teenagers to be portrayed by actors in their mid-twenties because they can work much longer hours,” Crosbie says. “Directors also don’t have to hire school teachers or someone to monitor them while on set like you do with teenage actors.” </p>

			<p> Crosbie is most known for her recurring role as Emily Prescott in the Nickelodeon series, Wits Academy. </p>

			<p> Additionally she starred alongside Cara Delevingne and Nat Wolff as Ruthie in the film adaptation of the book <i> Paper Towns </i> by John Green. </p>

			<p> Crosbie’s acting career came to a halt when she began high school as her desire for a “normal” life took over. </p>

			<p> “Casting older actors comes down mainly to experience and budgeting,” Crosbie says. “With age comes maturity and participation in a wider variety of roles, so it’s honestly just easier on the crew when the actors are more experienced.” </p>

			<p> Crosbie’s lack of experience and young age had her passed for numerous roles prior to her departure from television. </p>

			<p> Joel Thurm, Grease casting director, revealed in an <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11950015/Grease-casting-director-FINALLY-reveals-stars-older-high-school-characters.html" target="_blank"> interview</a>  with the Daily Mail why he casted actors primarily in their late twenties and early thirties to portray a high school friend group. </p>

			<p> “Grease is not a documentary; it’s a fantasy,” Thurm says. “It’s better for the cast not being teens. The only thing that was important was that the cast all looked about the same age as each other, which they did.” </p>

			<p> Screen Rant highlighted this interview in an article titled <a href="https://screenrant.com/hollywood-casting-older-actors-high-school-students-why/" target="_blank"> ‘Why Hollywood Keeps Casting Older Actors As High School Students’</a> written by Cooper Hood. </p>

			<p> The article further explains the technicalities and logistics behind this decision making process. </p>

			<p> “Since teenagers are not legally adults, they have limitations on how long they can work in a single day. In California, minors are also not allowed to work for more than five days consecutively. There is also the issue of schooling that most minors are still required to complete. So, instead of having the authenticity of an actual teenager in a leading role, most productions would rather elect to cast slightly older so these restrictions do not apply.” </p>
			
			<p> There’s also an aspect of appeal that goes into consideration because of the notion that older leads have a larger demographic appeal. Anything starring real teenagers is going to usually skew towards younger audiences. If older actors fill these roles instead, it could give the project wider appeal, leading to possibly more exposure and success. </p>

			<h3>DATA</h3>

			<p> The chart below depicts the characters who had an age difference of at least 10 years between them and the actors portraying them. There were 33 out of the total 240 actors displayed in Thomas' dataset. </p> 

			<iframe title="Character Age vs. Actor Age" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-EEGjb" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EEGjb/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="734" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
			</script>

			<p> While analyzing the data, the question arose of whether the age difference skewed higher for men or women, or if there was no difference at all. The chart below showcases those differences found during data analyzation. </p>

			<iframe title="Male vs. Female Average Age Difference" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-hiLil" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hiLil/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="258" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
			</script>

			<p> The chart above shows little to no difference because there is none! </p>

			<p> The average age difference between actors and their characters for this dataset sits at 5.9608 for males and 6.0082 for females. With rounding, we can conclude the average difference overall, regardless of gender, is 6 years. </p>

			<p> Since the data Thomas collected was representative of a variety of shows, spanning from the ‘90s to as recent as 2022, it’s apparent that this casting technique has remained true to its origins and effectiveness. </p>

			<p> While limitations could lessen in the future, it’s reasonable to assume we will see a continued pattern of actors playing characters much younger than themselves for years to come. </p>
